## Project Setup

First, install the packages required for the project

```bash
npm install
```

We are using the **Google Sheets API**. For that, we created the credentials using Semana da Computação's email on console.cloud.google.com.

Then, make sure you have the **Google Credentials** file to run the project. You must place it on "/app/util/g-credentials.json".

## Running the project

After following the steps above and meeting its requeriments, run in the terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
